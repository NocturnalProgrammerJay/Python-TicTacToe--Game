# Python Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a Python-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built using OOP principles and created in Replit.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Replit

## Features
This Tic-Tac-Toe game has the following features:
- A two-player mode where players take turns to place their marks (either X or O) on the board.
- An AI mode where a single player can play against the computer, which uses a simple algorithm to make its moves.
- A reset function to start a new game.

6. To start a new game, click on the reset button.

## Conclusion
Building this Python Tic-Tac-Toe game using OOP principles was a great learning experience. I was able to apply my knowledge of OOP and Python programming to create a fun and interactive game. I look forward to building more applications using these principles and expanding my knowledge of programming.
